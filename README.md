# SVM from Scratch

This repository contains a simple implementation of a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) written without external dependencies like NumPy.

## Files

- `svm.py` â€“ Implementation of a linear SVM using stochastic gradient descent.

## Usage

Run the demo script:

```bash
python3 svm.py
```

The script trains on a small OR-gate dataset and prints the predictions for each sample.
